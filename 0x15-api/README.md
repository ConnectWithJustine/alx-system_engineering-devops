## Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python
CamelCase is often used as a naming convention in computer programming. This naming convention helps improve the readability of code and makes it easier for developers to distinguish classes from functions and variables. It also aligns with the conventions used in many popular Python libraries and frameworks, promoting consistency across different codebases
```
Example of CamelCase:
YouTube
eBay etc
```
