# 0x16. API Advanced

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on mastering advanced API usage. Whether you're diving into API documentation, handling pagination, parsing JSON, making recursive calls, or sorting dictionaries, this README has you covered.

## 1. Reading API Documentation

### 1.1 Endpoints Identification
- **Endpoint Overview:** Start by exploring the API documentation to understand the available endpoints. Look for a detailed breakdown of each endpoint's purpose, required parameters, and potential responses.

### 1.2 Authentication
- **Authentication Mechanism:** Delve into the authentication section to comprehend the required keys, tokens, or credentials. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the desired endpoints.

### 1.3 Request Methods
- **HTTP Methods:** Understand the appropriate HTTP methods for your tasks (e.g., GET, POST). Take note of any required headers, query parameters, or additional configurations specified in the documentation.

### 1.4 Response Formats
- **Expected Response Format:** Investigate the expected format of API responses, usually in JSON. Learn the structure to effectively extract relevant data.

## 2. Handling API Pagination

### 2.1 Identifying Pagination
- **Pagination Indicators:** Recognize pagination indicators within the API responses, such as "next" links, page numbers, or cursors.

### 2.2 Limit and Offset Parameters
- **Pagination Parameters:** Some APIs use parameters like `limit` and `offset` to control the amount of data returned. Learn how to incorporate these parameters into your requests.

## 3. Parsing JSON Results

### 3.1 JSON Basics
- **Understanding JSON:** Familiarize yourself with JSON syntax, distinguishing between objects, arrays, and key-value pairs.

### 3.2 Useful Tools
- **JSON Tools:** Utilize programming languages or online tools to format and validate JSON. Ensure accurate interpretation for effective parsing.

## 4. Making Recursive API Calls

### 4.1 Recursive Function
- **Implementing Recursion:** Develop a recursive function to handle scenarios requiring repeated API calls. Establish proper termination conditions to prevent infinite loops.

### 4.2 Rate Limiting
- **Consider Rate Limits:** Be mindful of API rate limits. Adjust recursion depth and frequency to stay within acceptable limits.

## 5. Sorting a Dictionary by Value

### 5.1 Use of `sorted()` Function
- **Sorting Mechanism:** Use the `sorted()` function available in your programming language. Customize it with a lambda function to sort dictionaries by values.

### 5.2 Ascending or Descending
- **Ordering Options:** Choose between ascending (`reverse=False`) and descending (`reverse=True`) order based on your specific requirements.


Happy coding!
