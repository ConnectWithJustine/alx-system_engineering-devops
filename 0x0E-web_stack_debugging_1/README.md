## Protocol:
A protocol in networking refers to a set of rules and conventions that dictate how data is transmitted between devices. It ensures standardized communication by defining the format, sequencing, error checking, and other aspects of data exchange.

## IP Address:
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. It serves two main purposes: host or network interface identification and location addressing.

## TCP/IP:
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols that provides end-to-end communication across networks. TCP manages the data flow between devices, ensuring reliability, while IP handles the addressing and routing of the data.

## Internet Protocol (IP) Port:
An IP port is a 16-bit number used to identify specific processes to which Internet traffic should be directed within a device. It complements the IP address, allowing multiple services on a single device to function simultaneously.
