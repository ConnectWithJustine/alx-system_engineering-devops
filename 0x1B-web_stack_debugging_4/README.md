# 0x1B. Web stack debugging #4

## Overview

This project focuses on addressing web stack debugging challenges, specifically within the context of "0x1B. Web stack debugging #4." In this guide, we'll explore the Apache Benchmark tool and its application in web stack testing.

## Apache Benchmark Tool

### Introduction

Apache Benchmark, often referred to as `ab`, is a command-line tool designed for benchmarking and stress testing HTTP servers. It allows users to simulate multiple requests to a web server, providing insights into its performance, concurrency handling, and response times.

### Usage

To use Apache Benchmark, you can employ the following command structure:

```bash
ab -c <concurrent_connections> -n <total_requests> <target_url>
```

- `-c <concurrent_connections>`: Specifies the number of concurrent connections to simulate.
- `-n <total_requests>`: Sets the total number of requests to be made during the test.
- `<target_url>`: Represents the target URL or server where the requests will be sent.

### Example

As an example, the following command simulates 100 concurrent connections, each making a total of 2000 requests to a local server:

```bash
ab -c 100 -n 2000 localhost/
```

### Interpretation

The results generated by Apache Benchmark include valuable metrics such as requests per second, connection times, and server processing times. These metrics aid in assessing the server's performance under varying loads.
